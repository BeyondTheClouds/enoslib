‚öíÔ∏è Changelog
============

7.0.0
-----

- Introduce a way to configure the library.
  For now this can be used to control the cache used when accessing the G5k API.
- Jupyter integration
    - Provider configuration, roles and networks can be displayed in a rich format in a jupyter notebook
    - svc/locust: can display some information
- api/objects: introduce ``RolesLike`` type: something that looks like to some
    remote machines.  More precisely, it's a Union of some types: a ``Host``, a list
    of Host or a plain-old ``Roles`` datastructure. It's reduce the number of
    function of the API since function overloading isn't possible in Python.
- api:run_command: can now use ``raw`` connections (no need for python at the dest)
- api: introduce `bg_start`, `bg_stop` that generates the command for
  starting/stopping backgroung process on the remote nodes.
- api: introduce `background` keyword. It serves the same purpose of
  `bg_start/end` but is more generic in the sense that many modules can benefit
  from the keyword and it doesn't have any dependencies. Under the hood this will
  generate an async Ansible tasks with infinite timeout.
- svc/dstat: make it a context manager, adapt the examples
- svc/tcpdump: make it a context manager, adapt the examples
- svc/locust: update to the latest version. align the API to support parameter-less ``deploy`` method
    (run ``headless`` by default)
- Doc: they-use-it updated


6.2.0
-----

- svc/docker: now installs `nvidia-container-toolkit` if deemed relevant (on
  nodes that have a NVidia GPU card).
- svc/monitoring: now configures an `nvidia-smi` input on nodes that have a
  NVidia GPU card and the nvidia container runtime. Add an example to show how to
  make both service together to get some GPU metrics in the collector.
- docs: fixed missing network selection in ``tuto_svc_netem_s.py``
- jinja2 3.x compatibility

Possibly breaking:

- We've relaxed the Ansible version that is pulled when installing EnOSlib.
  Version ranging from Ansible 2.9 to Ansible 4 (excluded) are now accepted.
  There's a potential risk that some corner cases are broken (nothing bad has been
  detected though ... ü§û)
  This was necessary to get benefit from the latest modules version.
  EnOSlib can benefit from any (third party or updated core) collections
  installed locally.

6.1.0
-----

Breaking:

- svc/netem-htb: Rework on the various service APIs. Now the user can use a
    builder pattern to construct its network topology with Netem and NetemHTB.
    Check the examples to see how it looks like. Unfortunately this breaks the
    existing APIs.

Misc:

- provider: Openstack provider fixed
- api: add ``run_once`` and ``delegate_to`` keywords
- api: add ``populate_keys`` that populate ssh keys on all hosts (use case:
  MPI applications that needs to all hosts to be ssh reachable)
- tasks: env implements ``__contains__`` (resp. ``setdefault``) to check if a
  key is in the env (resp. set a default value) (cherry-pick from 5.x)
- svc/monitoring: remove the use of explicit ``become`` in the deployment

6.0.4
-----

- svc/docker: allow to specify a port (cherry-pick from 5.x)
- doc: fix typo  + some improvements (emojis)
- api/play_on: now accepts an Ansible Inventory (cherry-pick from 5.x)

5.5.2
-----

- svc/docker: allow to specify a port

6.0.3
-----

- svc:netem: fix an issue with missing self.extra_vars
- svc:monitoring: stick to influxdb < 2 for now (influxdb2 requires an auth)

6.0.2
-----

Doc/G5k: Add an example that makes use of the internal docker registries of
         Grid'5000

6.0.1
-----

Doc: install instructions on the front page
Doc/G5k: Document G5kTunnel

6.0.0 (the IPv6 release and plenty other stuffs)
------------------------------------------------

- Beware this versions has breaking changes in various places
- Networks from the various providers deserved a true abstraction: it's done.

  - ``provider.init`` now returns two similar data structures: Compute roles
    (aka ``roles``) and networks roles (``aka networks``). Both are
    dictionnaries of ``Host`` (resp. ``Networks``) indexed by the user provided
    tags.

  - Networks returned by a provider encompass IPv4 and IPv6 networks. User
    can filter them afterwards based on the wanted type.
    For instance a user reserving a vlan on Grid'5000 will be given two networks
    corresponding to the IPv4 kavlan network and its IPv6 counterpart.

  - Most of services have been updated to support the above change.

- Introduce ``enoslib.objects`` to organise library level objects. You'll
  find there ``Host`` and ``Network`` data structure and some other objects definitions.

- ``Host`` now have a ``net_devices`` and ``processor`` attributes. These
  attributes is populated by ``sync_info`` API function with the actual network
  devices information (IPv4/IPv6 addresses, device type...) and processor
  information.

- ``Host`` now have a ``processor`` attribute. This attribute is populated by
  ``sync_info`` API function with the actual processor information (number of
  cores, number of threads...)

- Netem service has been split in two parts. First, you can enforce in and
  out limitations on remote NIC cards (see ``netem`` module). Ingress
  limitations use virtual ifbs. Second do the same but allow to add filters
  (based on Hierarchical Token Bucket) on the queuing discipline to set
  heterogeneous limitations on a single NIC card (see ``htb`` module).

- API: ``discover_networks`` is now ``sync_info`` as it syncs more than networks.

- API: ``wait_for`` is the new name for ``wait_ssh``. The rationale is that
  we actually defer the connection to one Ansible plugin (which may or may not
  be the SSH plugin)

- API: ``run_ansible`` implements a retry logic independent to the connection
  plugin used.

- API: functions that calls ``run_ansible`` now accepts keyword arguments
  that are passed down the stack (instead of being explicit). This includes
  ``extra_vars``ansible_retries``.

- Introduce ``enoslib.docker`` module to manage docker containers as first
  class citizens. In particular, ``DockerHost`` is a specialization of
  ``Host``.

- Introduce ``enoslib.local`` to manage the local machine as an EnOSlib host.

- Providers: Any provider can now be used using a context manager. The
  resources will be release when leaving the context.

- Documentation has been reorganized and now uses a new theme (pydata-sphinx-theme)

- Note that the Openstack provider is broken currently.

5.5.4
-----

- tasks: env implements ``__contains__`` (resp. ``setdefault``) to check if a
  key is in the env (resp. set a default value)

5.5.3
-----

- api: ``play_on`` can be called with an inventory file


5.5.2
-----

- svc/docker: allow to specify a port

5.5.1
-----

- G5k: support for ``exotic`` job type. If you want to reserve a node on
  exotic hardware, you can pass either ``job_type=[allow_classic_ssh, exotic]``
  or ``job_type=[deploy, exotic]``. Passing a single string to ``job_type`` is
  also possible (backward compatibility)

5.5.0
-----

-  	üéâ New provider	üéâ: Iotlab provides resources on https://www.iot-lab.info/.

  - Reserve nodes and run some actions (radio monitoring, power consumption, run modules on A8 nodes)

  - Connection between Grid'5000 and Fit:

    - Using Grid'5000 VPN: allow bi-redirectionnal communication over IPv4

    - Using IPv6: allow transparent communication between both platform (limitation: connection established from Fit to G5k are currently dropped)

- Monitoring Service:

    - The monitoring stack can span both Grid'5000 (ui, collector, agents) and Fit platform (agents only).

-‚ú® New Dask Service ‚ú®: Deploy a Dask cluster on your nodes.

    - Replace the former Dask Service and allow for on demand computation (*just in time* deployment.)

    - Example updated accordingly

- G5k: G5kTunnel context manager to automatically manage a tunnel from your current machine to Grid'5000 machines.

Warning breaking changes:

- EnOSlib is python3.5+ compatible exclusively.

- Provider: a provider must be given a configuration object. You can build it
  from a dictionnary (this mimics EnOSlib 1.x) or build it programmaticaly. In
  pseudo code, changes are needed in your code as follow:
  ```
  from enoslib.infra.enos_g5k.configuration import Configuration
  from enoslib.infra.enos_g5k.provider import G5k
  ...
  conf = Configuration.from_dictionnary(provider_conf)
  g5k = G5k(conf)
  ...
  ```

- Provider: Configuration object
  The configuration object aim at ease the process of building configuration for
  providers. It can be validated against a jsonschema defined for each provider.
  Validation is implicit using `from_dictionnary` or explicit using the
  `finalize()` method of the configuration.

- Doc: Update docs to reflect the above

- VMonG5K: new provider that allows to start virtual machines on G5K.
