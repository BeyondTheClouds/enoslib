    From the user perspective, a RolesDict's instance ``roles`` is a
    dictionary.  To retrieve all the corresponding machine with the tag ``tag``
    one can use `Ì€`roles[tag]``.

    The value associated with a tag behaves like a set (it's a
    py:class:`~enoslib.collections.ResourcesSet`). So classical set operations
    are possible, for instance ``roles[tag1] & roles[tag2]`` will give you back
    the set of resources that are both tagged with ``tag1`` and ``tag2``.

    This set also accepts some list operations (as it seems that users
    are more familiar with them). So it's possible to call ``append``,
    ``extend``, etc. Indexing comes with some caveats however:
    ``roles["tag"][0]`` will give you the first resource in the *alphabetical
    order* associated with the tag ``tag``(not the first inserted machine as
    you'd expect with a regular list).
