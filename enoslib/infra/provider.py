class Provider:
    """Base class for the provider.

    Providers are components that are responsible for acquiring resources on
    existing testbeds. Concretely, a provider takes a declarative description
    of the expected resources as argument. It requests the resources on the
    corresponding testbed, and returns a set of hosts and networks labeled
    with their roles. In other words, providers help the experimenter deal
    with the variety of the APIs of testbeds.

    Some infrastructure is based on a reservation system (OAR, blazar ...).  In
    this case we defer to the decision to start the resource to the underlying
    scheduler. This scheduler will try to find an available ``start_time`` for
    our configuration in a near future if possible.

    In the above situation reservation in advance is possible and can be set in
    the corresponding configuration, using
    :py:meth:`~enoslib.infra.provider.Provider.set_reservation` or
    :py:meth:`~enoslib.infra.provider.Provider.init` with the ``start_time``
    parameter set.

    Args:
        provider_conf (BaseConfiguration): configuration of the provider.
            The configuration object is specific to each provider and must follow
            the provider's schema

    Example:

        Typical workflow:

            .. code-block:: python

                # craft a conf (provider specific)
                conf = Configuration() ...

                provider = Provider(conf)
                roles, networks = provider.init()

                # release resources
                provider.destroy()


        Using a context manager

            .. code-block:: python

                # craft a conf (provider specific)
                conf = Configuration() ...

                with provider(conf) as (roles, networks):
                    # do stuff with roles and networks
                    ...
                # Resources are automatically released at the end
