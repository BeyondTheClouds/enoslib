        The function does the heavy lifting of transforming your
        abstract resource configuration into concrete resources.

        From a high level perspective it works as follow:

        - First it transforms the configuration of resources into an actual
          OAR resource selection string (one single reservation per provider
          instance).
        - It requests the API to get the corresponding resources (job and
          optionally deploys a environment)
        - Those resources are then mapped back to every single item on the
          configuration.
        - Finally it applies some more operations (set nodes on vlans,
          configure secondary interfaces) before returning.

        .. note::

            The call to the function is **idempotent** and the following is ensured:

            - Existing job(s) (based on the name) will be reloaded.
            - The mapping between concrete resources and their corresponding roles
              is fixed across runs. This includes:

              - the mapping between machines and roles
              - the mapping between networks and roles
              - the mapping between network cards and networks

            - Deployments is performed only on nodes that are not deployed yet
              (up to three attempts).
            - At the end machine are reachable using the root account.
