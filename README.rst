What the ☆homoterogeneous☆ ?
----------------------------

Distributed systems practitioners on bare-metal testbeds know it: resources
(e.g. computes, networks) on a bare-metal infrastructure may have these slight
differences between each other that experimental code can become hairy. For
such code, achieving practical portability (e.g changing the infrastructure
parameters) is thus a tedious time consuming task.


☆Homoterogeneous☆ has been coined to express the gap between the idea
we have of a computing infrastructure, where resources have
static/predictable setup, and the reality of interacting with them on a daily
basis.

In this context, EnOSlib smoothes the experimental code and can

- deal with various platforms (e.g. local machine, scientific testbed, virtualized environments)
- interact programmatically with different your remote resources: compute
  (servers, containers) and networks (ipv4, ipv6)
- deploy *ready-to-use* experimentation services (e.g instrumentation, observability tools).
- emulate complex network topologies (e.g for your FOG experiments)
- integrate your code with interactive development environment like Jupyter.


The software
------------

EnOSlib has been initially developed in the context of the `Discovery
<https://beyondtheclouds.github.io/>`_ initiative and is released under the
GPLv3 licence. It's a library written in Python: you are free to import it in
your code and cherry-pick any of its functions.


.. hint::

   You can install EnOSlib with pip:

   .. code-block ::

      pip install enoslib
      # If you are a Jupyter User
      pip install enoslib[jupyter]

   For developping EnOSlib or get the *in development* version:

   .. code-block ::

      git clone https://gitlab.inria.fr/discovery/enoslib.git
      cd enoslib && pip install -U -e .
